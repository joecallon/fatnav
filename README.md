# fatNav
I really like [Glitchbone's fatNav](https://github.com/Glitchbone/jquery-fatNav), but sadly he seems to no longer be maintaining the project. This is my version, which removes the necessity for your hamburger to be fixed.

Using this version, fatNav will not automagically add the hamburger for you. This gives you the freedom to place it wherever you fancy.

```html
<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="hamburger"><div class="hamburger__icon"></div></a>
```
Add the above code where you want your hamburger to appear, and you're away.
